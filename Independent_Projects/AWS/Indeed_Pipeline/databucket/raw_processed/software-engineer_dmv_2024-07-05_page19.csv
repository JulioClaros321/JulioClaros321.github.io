standardized semantically-structured assertions (sss assertions) about cell phenotypes for loading into the c2dkb graph knowledgebase. the graph database developer will integrate these c2dkb cell phenotypes with disease, drug, and other complementary information from external public graph knowledgebases (e.g., spoke) to facilitate the core mechanistic, diagnostic, and therapeutic discovery use cases. the graph database developer will also develop and implement an intuitive user-friendly query, visualization, and analysis interface for semantic network exploration, graphical machine learning pattern discovery, and computational comparison of new datasets for cell type matching, with a focus on maximizing user experience (ux). the end delivered product will be an open access reference knowledgebase about healthy and diseased cell phenotypes designed to meet the needs of the general biomedical research community. specific tasks include: provide guidance on use of information retrieval and extraction techniques to increase the utility of unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data, including application of semantic and ontology-based methods for organization and query of scientific knowledge. lead the creation of strategies for the deployment, construction, and querying of data systems, including relational database management systems (rdbms), nosql systems (e.g., graph databases, rdf subject-predicate-object triple stores) and sparql and cypher query languages to gather and analyze biomedical research data. collaborate with the development team to design, develop, and maintain knowledge graph databases for intelligence analysis purposes. collaborate with intelligence analysts and subject matter experts to understand requirements and translate them into effective database designs. support implementation of the data integration processes to extract, transform, and load structured and unstructured data from various sources into the knowledge
