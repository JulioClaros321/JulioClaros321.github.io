                Investing can be intimidating, especially when theres hundreds of stocks to analyze. This can often deter
                new and old investors from seeking out financial freedom.

            <p>
                Script uses Python's Pandas and Robin Stock's API to analyze annual real-time and historic stock prices 
                in order to identify trends and present opportunities for both long-term and short-term trading strategies. 
                This tool is intended to minimize search time for investors and does not eliminate "due diligence", 
                a fundamental skill learned through investing.

            <h3 id="problem">Data Preparation and Cleaning</h3>
            <p>
                We used various data tools, such as OpenRefine, Excel, and Python, to remove null values, fix data types, and isolate a 
                sample size of students that would serve as our group for analysis (around 50 primary schools IT students from Kuwait). 
                The goal of this analysis was to analyze the recorded student participatory behaviors and determine their 
                relationship/correlation to student performance.
            </p>
            
            <h3 id="solution">Insight/Findings</h3>
            <p>
                After several visualizations, I found that student participatory behavior frequencies, such as hands raised, 
                discussion participation, resources visited, and attendance had a positive correlation with academic performance. 
                Students, who had an above-average performance, were more likely to raise their hands, participate in discussions, 
                and visit resources. Vice versa, students who performed poorly would have lower frequencies in these categories. 
                Surprisingly, parental involvement had a weak relationship to performance; however, it had a strong positive relationship 
                with attendance. Parents who did not answer the survey were more likely to have students absent more than seven days in the 
                academic year: a potential negative indirect relationship.

            <p>
                Finding a job can be extremely intimidating. Many employers have crazy requirments for even entry-level positions. I aimed at creating a tool that would give
                guidance to people seeking opportunities. Whether gathering insight on job requirements, looking for key words to make your resume pass automated filters, or even looking
                at salary expectations, this tool aims to give people the insight to increase their chances at getting a job
            </p>
            
            <h3 id="solution">Insight/Findings</h3>
            <p>
                I used selenium, beautiful soup, and web-generated lists in Excel to filter key word frequencies in job descriptions to
                increase awareness of employer requirements and increase chances of passing automated resume machines. Visualizations are 
                generated off various skills, personality traits, educational requirements, and salary expectations mentioned per job title. 
                Program condenses information into a .csv file for querying in SQL.
